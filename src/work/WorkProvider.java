/**
 * Service-provider class
 * <p/>
 * A service is normally just the definition of a method/interface.
 * <p/>
 * The methods defined in a static class will typically delegate to an instance of this
 * class.
 * <p/>
 * A service provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
 * implements the abstract methods defined by this class.
 * <p/>
 * A provider is identified by a {@code URI} {@link #getScheme() scheme}.
 * <p/>
 * A factory method class defines how providers are located
 * and loaded.
 * The first invocation of a method (such as installedProviders)
 * locates and loads all installed file system providers.
 * Installed providers are loaded using the service-provider loading facility defined by the ServiceLoader class.
 * Installed providers are loaded using the system class loader.
 * If the system class loader cannot be found then the extension class loader is used; if there is no extension class loader then the bootstrap class loader is used.
 * <p/>
 * Default parameters may be overridden by setting a system property.
 * <p/>
 * All providers have generally zero argument constructor that initializes the provider.
 * <p/>
 * A provider is a factory for one or more (service) object instances.
 * Each service is identified by a {@code URI} where the URI's scheme matches
 * the provider's {@link #getScheme scheme}.
 * <p/>
 * Inspired by {@link java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider}
